## Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

This project is an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard developed using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard analyzes 4,00,000+ road accident records to identify trends related to casualties, vehicle types, road conditions, locations, and time patterns, helping stakeholders understand accident causes and improve road safety decisions.

### Dataset Summary

* Records Analyzed: 4,00,000+ accident records
* Coverage: Nationwide road accident data
* Key Metrics: Casualties, Accidents, Vehicle Type, Road Type, Light Condition, Weather Condition, Location
* Time Dimension: Year-wise, month-wise, and day-wise data

### Objectives

1. Analyze overall accident and casualty trends.
2. Identify high-risk road types and locations.
3. Evaluate the impact of vehicle type on accident severity.
4. Study time-based accident patterns.
5. Support safety planning using data-driven insights.

### Dashboard Capabilities

1. KPI cards showing Total Accidents, Total Casualties, Fatal Casualties, and Serious Injuries.
2. Analysis of casualties by vehicle type (Cars, Bikes, Trucks, Buses, Others).
3. Breakdown of accidents by road type (Single carriageway, Dual carriageway, Roundabout, etc.).
4. Comparison of accidents under different light conditions (Daylight vs Darkness).
5. Analysis based on weather conditions such as fine, rain, fog, and snow.
6. **Monthly and yearly trend analysis to identify accident patterns.
7. Identification of high-risk locations based on casualty count.
8. Interactive filters and slicers for year, location, and accident severity.

### Tools & Technologies Used
